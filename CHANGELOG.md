Version 19.11.1 â€“ October 7, 2025
Patch release addressing the longstanding Swift concurrency crash (GH-434) and improving the internal rate-limiting system for better stability and efficiency.

Changes
- Refactored WorkRateLimiter to improve efficiency and reliability, reduce memory overhead, and eliminate unnecessary temporary allocations.
- Added stronger safeguards to WorkRateLimiter prevent rare edge-case crashes in rate-limiting logic.

## Version 19.11.0 - September 30, 2025

This is an important update for apps using manual push notification integration (automaticSetup = false). We are addressing a lifecycle issue caused by Apple's async notification delegate being called on a background thread, unlike the main-thread-guaranteed completionHandler version. To align with the correct lifecycle, we are deprecating our async handler and introducing a new completionHandler method. Using the async version can cause
direct open counts to be lower than expected.

### Changes
- Added a new synchronous `AppIntegration.userNotificationCenter(_:didReceive:withCompletionHandler:)` method. Apps must use this and the corresponding synchronous delegate method to ensure notification responses are handled before the app becomes active.
- The async `AppIntegration.userNotificationCenter(_:didReceive:)` method is now deprecated.
- Landing pages no longer display for push notifications received when the app is in the foreground.



## Version 19.10.0 - September 22, 2025
Minor release that adds a new flag to work around the critical crash (GH-434) affecting Swift 5 apps on Xcode 16.1+. The problematic feature is now disabled by default.

### Changes
- Added `isDynamicBackgroundWaitTimeEnabled` flag. This defaults to `false` to avoid the crash. It is strongly recommended to keep this `false` for Swift 5 apps. Swift 6 apps can safely set this to `true` to restore previous behaviors.

## Version 19.9.2 - September 15, 2025
Patch release that resolves a crash eminating from the Thomas video player, fixes a bug that causes Scenes to sometimes display after being stopped, and fixes some UI bugs exposed by iOS 26.

### Changes
- Fixed refreshing out of date In-App Automations and Scenes before displaying.  
- Fixed KVO in ThomasVideoPlayer to use modern patterns and properly release observers.
- Fixed Message Center title bar theming in iOS 26.
- Improved tab bar UI in iOS 26.


## Version 19.9.1 - September 10, 2025
Patch release that fixes backwards Swift 5 compatibility. Users that plan to use the 19.9.1-swift5 branch are encouraged to update.

### Changes
- Fixed default parameter initialization by moving @MainActor object creation from parameter defaults to method bodies in ThomasEnvironment, ThomasState, and ThomasFormField.

## Version 19.9.0 - September 4, 2025
Minor release that adds a new flag to HTML In-App message content to force full screen on all devices.

### Changes
- Added `forceFullScreen` to HTML In-App message content

### Version 19.8.3 - August 25, 2025

A patch release that includes a targeted fix for the ongoing Swift interoperability crashes outlined in GH-434.

### Changes
- Updated the concurrency pattern in the background task scheduler, replacing a `for-await` loop with a `TaskGroup`. This change targets a suspected instability in Swift's concurrency runtime and is expected to mitigate the crashes seen in mixed Swift 5/6 environments.
- Fixed a Scene issue where labels marked as H3 were being treated as H1.
- Improved accessibility of embedded Scenes by announcing screen changes when an embedded view is displayed.

## Version 19.8.2 - August 19, 2025
A patch release with bug fixes for video in scenes and Swift interoperability crashes. Users that have upgraded to SDK 19.6.0+ and display Youtube or Vimeo videos in Scenes or In-app Messages or are experiencing crashes like those outlined in GH-434 are encouraged to update. 

### Changes
- Fixed bug preventing proper rendering of youtube and vimeo videos in Scenes and In-app Messages.
- Fixed Swift 5-6 interop issues causing crashes in Workers.calculateBackgroundWaitTime(maxTime:) outlined in github issue 434.

## Version 19.8.1 - August 6, 2025
A patch release with improved Xcode 26 support, a fix for custom font scaling in scenes, and internal improvements to image loading.

### Changes
- Fixed issues affecting custom font scaling.
- Improved image loading support.
- Fixed a compilation error caused by SwiftUICore import exposed by Xcode 26 beta 4.

## Version 19.8.0 - July 24, 2025
A minor release with improvements to Scenes and a new `dismiss` command for the JS interface.

### Changes
- Added support in Scenes for linking form inputs to a label for better accessibility.
- Added container item alignment to Scenes to change the natural alignment within a container.
- Added a new `dismiss` command to the JavaScript interface for parity with Android. The new `UAirship.dismiss()` method behaves the same as `UAirship.cancel()`.

## Version 19.7.0 - July 18, 2025
A minor release that simplifies takeOff by deprecating methods with launchOptions, adds flexibility for initialization, and includes several bug fixes.

### Changes
- Deprecated `Airship.takeOff` methods that include launchOptions. The takeOff method still needs to be called before `application(_:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:)` finishes to ensure proper notification delegate is set up.
- Updated `Airship.takeOff` to allow it to be called from `MainApp.init` before the application delegate is set, even with automatic setup enabled.
- Fixed a stack overflow exception when using Scenes in the iOS 26 beta.
- Added a potential workaround for reported crashes within `AirshipWorkManager` and `AirshipChannel`.
- Fixed a race condition in Scene asset file operations and improved file management.

## Version 19.6.1 - June 24, 2025
Patch release with bug fixes for memory management, survey interactions, and accessibility improvements.

### Changes
- Fixed a memory issue in `AirshipWorkManager` where temporary arrays were being created unnecessarily when calculating background wait times.
- Fixed an issue where NPS survey score selection required double-tapping by properly restoring both the score value and index when loading from form state.
- Fixed a potential crash when updating constraints for banner views that have been removed from the view hierarchy.
- Improved VoiceOver accessibility by ensuring toggles, checkboxes, and radio inputs remain accessible even without explicit accessibility descriptions.
- Added accessibility header traits to section titles in Message Center, Preference Center, and other UI components for better VoiceOver navigation.

## Version 19.6.0 - June 17, 2025
