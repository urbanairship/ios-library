## Version 16.12.1, June 14, 2023
Patch release that fixes app deep links that use the `uairship://` prefix. Any `uairship://` deep links that are not handled by Airship directly will now be delivered to the `DeepLinkDelegate`.

## Version 16.12.0 June 12, 2023

## Version 16.11.0 February 22, 2023
Minor release that fixes a potential channel restore issue on second run. The impact should be small since the channel create will return the same channel ID if the app has a device token or the app installed the Message Center module. 

### Changes
- Fixed app restore detection false positive on second run
- Added new optional `PushNotificationDelegate` method `extendPresentationOptions(_:notification:completionHandler)` that allows returning foreground presentation options with a callback instead of synchronously
- Added new `Config` method `validate(logIssues:)` to prevent logging on the config.
- Fixed nil URL log message when attempting to create a channel on the first run. The channel will now wait until the URL is available before attempting to be created. This should not cause any real difference in behavior, it only prevents the log message from being logged.
- Fixed Xcode 14.3 beta build issues

## Version 16.10.7 January 17, 2023

## Version 16.10.0 October 24, 2022

- Fixed logging live activities update as an error instead of debug

## Version 16.10.0-beta October 6, 2022

Beta release for SDK 16.10.0 that adds support for live activities. To support live activities, you must call restore once after takeOff during `application(_:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:)` with all the live activity types that you
might track with Airship:

```
  Airship.takeOff(config, launchOptions: launchOptions)

  Task {
      await Airship.channel.restoreLiveActivityTracking { restorer in
          await restorer.restore(
            forType: Activity<DeliveryAttributes>.self
          )
          await restorer.restore(
            forType: Activity<SomeOtherAttributes>.self
          )
      }
  }
```

Then whenever you want Airship to track an activity, call trackLiveActivity on the channel instance with the name of the activity:

```
  Task {
      await Airship.channel.trackLiveActivity(
          activity,
          name: "my-neat-activity"
      )
  }
```

You will then be able to send updates through the Airship Push API to the live activity using the name `my-neat-activity`.

- Moved Preference Center and Message Center OOTB UI to use its own window instead of the current key window.

- Fixed deep links that contain invalid characters by encoding those deep links.

Airship SDK 14 is a major update that prepares our automation module to support future IAA enhancements, revamps the Channel Capture tool, and provides other improvements.

The majority of apps will only be effected by the new `UAURLAllowList` behavior changes.

### Changes
- **BEHAVIOR CHANGE** All URLs are not verified by default. Applications that use open URL action, landing pages, and custom in-app message image URLs will need to provide a list of URL patterns that match those URLs for SCOPE_OPEN_URL. The easiest way to go back to 13.x behavior is to add the wildcard symbol `*` to the array under the `URLAllowListScopeOpenURL` key in your AirshipConfig.plist.
- Channel Capture tool now detects a `knock` of 6 app opens in 30 seconds. Instead of displaying anything to the user, the tool will write the current channel ID to the clipboard.
- `UAWhitelist` class and terminology removed and replaced with `UAURLAllowList`.
- `UAActionAutomation` class and functionality has been moved to `UAInAppAutomation`, which covers both Action Automation and In-App Messages.
- In-App Automation APIs have been updated to support future IAA enhancements.
- Removed deprecated APIs.
